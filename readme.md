# shorten-url-code-challenge

## Backend part
The backend part should contain the implementation of the business logic of the url shortening. 
Ideally it should be a node application written in Typescript or Javascript

## Frontend part
The frontend part should be responsible for the user interface to shorten the URLs. In the repository that you will find below you will see that a part of the frontend (written in React JS) is already there and ready to run so you are asked to extend it and add the functionality missing. 

### Note
Also you will notice that in the README file there is a lot of information regarding Bitly, please ignore anything that has to do with this part as your goal is to deliver an end to end solution and not consume an already existing endpoint from an external api. 


Last but not least, as a deliverable you can submit a GitHub link containing your approach.

There is not an actual limitation to the hours spent in order to complete this exercise but in general it shouldn’t take more than 4-5 hours, so this means that you need to scope it as good as you can in order to meet this limit.
